ETL Telecom SSIS Project
GitHub Repository: ETL-Telecom-SSIS

Description:
Developed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process tailored for a telecommunications company using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). The project involved designing and implementing data pipelines to efficiently process and manage telecom data, ensuring data quality and integrity throughout the workflow.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Extraction: Automated the extraction of raw data from various sources, including CSV files generated periodically by the telecom system.
Data Transformation: Applied business rules and data quality checks to cleanse and transform the extracted data, handling errors and bad data appropriately.
Data Loading: Loaded the processed data into the target database, ensuring seamless integration with existing data models.
Error Handling and Auditing: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to log rejected transactions and maintain an audit trail for data processing activities.
File Management: Developed a system to archive processed files and manage file storage efficiently.
Technologies Used:

SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
SQL Server
T-SQL
Achievements:

Successfully streamlined the ETL process, resulting in improved data processing efficiency and accuracy.
Enhanced data quality by implementing comprehensive error handling and auditing procedures.
Facilitated better data management and accessibility for business intelligence and analytics purposes.
This project demonstrates your proficiency in data engineering, particularly in designing and implementing ETL processes using SSIS, and showcases your ability to handle complex data workflows in the telecommunications domain.
